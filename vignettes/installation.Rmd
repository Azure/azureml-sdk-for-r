## 1. Install Anaconda

To ensure that your environment is set up correctly for installation, you will first need to install the 64-bit binary of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for Python 3.5 or later.

## 2. Install `reticulate`
Next, install [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/). The bindings for AzureML SDK for R rely on `reticulate` to interface with [AzureML SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml) and run operations. If using Windows, make sure that [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is installed first.
```
> install.packages('reticulate')
```

## 3. Install `azureml` R package with `remotes`
As the `azureml` package is not available on CRAN, you will need `remotes` to install from the GitHub repo.
```
> install.packages('remotes')
```
Then, you can use the `install_github` function to install the package. Until the current repo is opened to the public, you will need to [generate a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and supply it along with your username.
```
> remotes::install_github('https://github.com/Azure/azureml-sdk-for-r',
                           user_name = '<your GitHub user name>',
                           auth_token = '<your personal access token>',
                           INSTALL_opts=c("--no-multiarch"))
```

## 4. Install azureml Python SDK
Lastly, use the `azureml` R package to create a conda environment called `r-azureml` where the Python SDK package will be installed.
```
> azureml::install_azureml()
```

## 5. Test installation
You can confirm your installation by loading the library and successfully retrieving a run.
```
> library(azureml)
> get_current_run()
<azureml.core.run._OfflineRun>
```
