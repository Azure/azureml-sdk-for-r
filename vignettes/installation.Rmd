## 1. Install Anaconda

To ensure that your environment is set up correctly for installation, you will first need to install the 64-bit binary of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for Python 3.5 or later.

## 2. Install `azureml` R package with `remotes`
As the `azureml` package is not available on CRAN, you will need `remotes` to install from the GitHub repo.
```
> install.packages('remotes')
```
Then, you can use the `install_github` function to install the package. Until the current repo is opened to the public, you will need to [generate a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and supply it along with your username.
```
> remotes::install_github('https://github.com/Azure/azureml-sdk-for-r',
                           user_name = '<your GitHub user name>',
                           auth_token = '<your personal access token>',
                           INSTALL_opts=c("--no-multiarch"))
```

## 3. Install azureml Python SDK
Lastly, use the `azureml` R package to create a conda environment called `r-azureml` where the Python SDK package will be installed.
```
> azureml::install_azureml()
```

## 4. Test installation
You can confirm your installation by loading the library and successfully retrieving a run.
```
> library(azureml)
> get_current_run()
<azureml.core.run._OfflineRun>
```

## Troubleshooting
In step 3 of the installation, if you get ssl errors on windows, it is due to an
outdated openssl binary. Install the latest openssl binaries from
[here](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries).
