## Using basic AzureML APIs

Before running the samples in RStudio, change to the sample directory in Rstudio using `setwd(dirname)`.
The examples assume that the data and scripts are in the current directory.

1. [setup.R](setup.R): Setup workspace before running samples.
2. [Train on ML Compute](training/train-on-amlcompute): train a model using an ML Compute cluster as compute target.
